# Bisu-Language-App

Is an app idea for the people of Obanliku Cross river State Nigeria
Though the People of Thailand Share a common terminology of the Language.

 \nBisuApp is an idea to help people learn about the Bisu Language.
"Bisu Language" as the name implies is in use in Thailand as a spoken Language too.
There is this believe that the "Thailand's Bisu Language was probably transferred or borrowed from the Bisu Natives of Obanliku, in Cross River State Nigeria probably during the early migrations of the
Thailand to Africa after or during Colonization. Could it be so, because the Thailand can travel almost anywhere in the planet…………..?
Well that could be a food for thought.
Though there is still an underlying desire to know the true connection of the term and language itself,
Tourism and other options are keys to unlocking this dilemma.
Hence if you Google “Bisu Language” most likely, The Thailand’s Bisu Language will show up first on Wikipedia the free encyclopedia.

Personally, my family is part of the Bisu tribe of the ethnic group of Obanliku in Cross River State Nigeria.
The Language is kind of endangered, as it’s not really being passed down from generation to generation any more.
My grandmother (Mrs. Ubine Uyie-Audu) was the last to speak the Language in the City more fluently.
So I like to preserve the culture with the app for families from Bisu tribe whom have long
migrated from the community to the city, Abroad, Overseas, for Marriages, Education, Businesses or Pursuits for greener pastures etc.
And the good interest of every good one out there to teach their kids how to pronounce numbers, Colors,
Phrases and probably have a little knowledge of their root".
Which is in line with a common quote in bisu Language “Wah yien ipeke wabese, wah yien ipeke wah yi se”
meaning;
“If you don’t know your root, you may not know where you’re going”.
